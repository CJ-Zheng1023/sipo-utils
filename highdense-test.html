    The present <span class="hl" style="color: red">invention</span> helps eliminate any phobia's or fears associated with using the phone.A common fear of using public phones for example is that it is used by a number of people everyday. Because the phone requires the user <span class="hl" style="color: blue">to</span> place the handset <span class="hl" style="color: blue">to</span> the users ear and mouth, bacteria and germs can easily be transmitted <span class="hl" style="color: blue">to</span> the handset and eventually <span class="hl" style="color: blue">to</span> the next user. <span class="hl" style="color: blue">To</span> prevent this from occurring, a sponge soaked in disinfectant is placed on the holder of the phone handset. After every use, the disinfectant sterilizes the phone handset killing common germs and bacteria that can originate from the user. This ensures that the phone <span class="hl" style="color: green">handset</span> is safe for use for the next user.
